# OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming

the languages which provide mechanism of OOP are called as object oriented languages
ex : Java, Python, C++, Javascript

java contains object oriented programming which is used to create the classes and classes can provide us large applications in real
life applications

so the object oriented languages comes with the large number of applications you can map any concept with the object orientation 
like say a car is there so the attributes of the car can act like the 

the classes four main features in programming and these are :

1) Abstraction
    it means that you just have use its applications and there is no need for you to see for its internal functionalities. 
    say you are using a TV at that time you just want to see TV but there is no need for you to know the internal structure of it 
    so in the classes you are free to use the class functions but at the same time there is no need of to know that how the functions 
    are implemented

2) Polymorphism

3) Encapsulation
4) Inheritance
