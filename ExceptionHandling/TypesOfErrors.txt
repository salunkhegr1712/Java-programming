inside this code i will going to explain the types of errors possible inside the programming
this errors are universal and it is not a case that a perticular language only has this errors

    # compile-time errors vs runtime errors 

    the compile time error are one which get invoked when we get error while we are doing  compilation
    the run time error are one which can get pumped out when .class or .exe file is under execution inside memory

    # concept

                            +-----------------+
                            |                 |
                            |                 |
                            |                 |
            Programmer ==>  |    Programme    | ==> User
                            |                 |
                            |                 |
                            |                 |

        so above digrame show that programmer write the code for programme and user is one which is going to use 
        the programme

        so programmer can get : i) Syntax errors  ii) logical errors

        after resolving those types of the error programmer gives the programme to user.

        so user can get : runtime errors
        
        so inorder to handle runtime errors and make user experience good programmer uses Exception handling
        so that it reduces crashing of programme due to some kind of runtime error


errors :

    a) Syntax errors
        
        such errors occurs when you fail to occur due to syntaxical mistakes inside the code 

        ex:
            i) int a,,b;//<identifier> expected
            ii) System.out.println("hello world');//unclosed string literal
            iii)    int x,y;
                    x=10+x+y+c;
                    //cannot find symbol;symbol: variable c; location: class code
            these above are some type of the common compilation errors which we tackle while doing coding
            these are visible errors so if you do mistakes like Syntax errors you may tackle Syntax errors
    
    b) logical errors

        this types of errors are the one which we cannot popped out but these are logical error made by programmer
        and these types of error found when you not get some expected error

        this are not like Syntax error which get popped up if do so; thats why these type of hard to remove and 
        we have to use the debugger to find out the error and resolve the issue 

        ex :
            you have to print a array and you mistakely started to index from 1 instead of the 0

            int arr[]= new int[10];

            for(int i=1;i<arr.length;i++){
                System.out.println(arr[i]);
            } 
            // such types of errors can be seen 

    c) runtime errors

        now these type of error are came due to wrong handling of the code from users end which lead to the malfunction of 
        programmer even though code for that programme is good

        these types of the error arises due to main two point which lead to crash of programme
        
        i) invalid input
        ii) unavailibility of resources 

        ex:

            in calculator user input 0 for denominator
            delete some neccesary file needed for execution of that programme
            some programme need internet connection and user dont have it
        
        this type of error can able to avoided and with the code itself can provide msg to user that 
        some things is went wrong and you can make that right so that your programme will run successfulley

    the Exception means that these programme will run except this Exceptions 
    with Exception we can provide msg to user and that will avoid such type of error

    # Exception handling

    Exception are run time error and we can handle such error with the use of the Exception handling
