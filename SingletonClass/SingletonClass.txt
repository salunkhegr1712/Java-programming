the singleton class is a class which can produce only one object and it will be shared through all the 
code and we will pass that object whenever needed

how to create the code for singleton set 

a) Create a private constructor so that we cant able to produce the object outside that class

    means outside class

        ClassName var= new ClassName();
        is prohibited outside class

b) Create a private and static class reference which can used throughout the proogram as singleton class has singleton object
    so this reference will store that object

    the reference is initially null

    ClassName a=null;
    
    and we will assign object to it inside the method which provide this object

c) Create a public and static function which will create new object if it not exists and if already created
    pass object for it 

    in such manner we can able to create the singleton classes


as we have a static reference and static method so we can access function to get instance of object. and call it by 

   ClassName reference= ClassName.function();

   such like that you can get object for it
