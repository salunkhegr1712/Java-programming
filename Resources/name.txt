+	          Addition	        Adds together two values	              x + y	
-	          Subtraction	      Subtracts one value from another	      x - y	
*	          Multiplication	  Multiplies two values	                  x * y	
/	          Division	        Divides one value by another	          x / y	
%	          Modulus	          Returns the division remainder	        x % y	
++	        Increment	        Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	        Decrement	        Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

#Assignment Operators

Operator	Example	  Same As	
  =	      x = 5	    x = 5	
  +=	    x += 3	  x = x + 3	
  -=	    x -= 3	  x = x - 3	
  *=	    x *= 3	  x = x * 3	
  /=	    x /= 3	  x = x / 3	
  %=	    x %= 3	  x = x % 3	
  &=	    x &= 3	  x = x & 3	
  |=	    x |= 3	  x = x | 3	
  ^=	    x ^= 3	  x = x ^ 3	
  >>=	    x >>= 3	  x = x >> 3	
  <<=	    x <<= 3	  x = x << 3
  
 #Java Comparison Operators
  
  
Operator	      Name	                  Example	
==	      Equal to	                    x == y	
!=	      Not equal	                    x != y	
>	        Greater than	                x > y	
<	        Less than	                    x < y	
>=	      Greater than or equal to	    x >= y	
<=	      Less than or equal to	        x <= y	

#Java Logical Operators

Operator	      Name	                  Description	                                         Example	
&& 	        Logical and	      Returns true if both statements are true	                x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	        Logical or	      Returns true if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 || x < 4	
!	        Logical not	      Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true   	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
