so here i will type some of the functionalities which java provide along with the methods 

# methods overloading 

java provide us the option to create multiple instances of same function so that so that they get triggered as the 
arguments passed to them you have look the code so that you will get much better idea about it  

the overloading function are always differ by each other by the parameters and each of the overloaded function
has own specific type of parameters you also can see them inside the code 

code :

    // return max between two integers
    static int max(int a,int b){
        // we are going to use the ternary operation in order to print the result 
        return a>b?a:b;
    }

    // return max between two float
    static float max(float a,float b){
        return a>b?a:b;
    }

    // return max between two literals
    static char max(char a,char b){
        return a>b?a:b;
    }

    // return max between two characters
    static char max(char a,char b){
        return a>b?a:b;
    }

this type of overloading and such overloaded function are so much common in many programming languague and it is also 
a reason to make a languague dynamic and multiutility and smart as the languague is smart enough to handle the parameters 
and also able to deduce the proper kind of the result from it
