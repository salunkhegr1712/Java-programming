here i will type the notes on the variable arguments inside the java methods

say see the following function and you have to make your function work in all given belowed conditions

show()
show(10)
show(10,20)
show(10,20,30)
show(10,20,30,40)
show(10,20,30,40,....)

so for such cases where we want to make it happen and write a single function and all of the above code
will be runnable for that we will going to use variableArguments here

but in java to declare this we have to use the parameters of same datatype

so syntax to use the variableArguments

    void show(int ... x){
        // this x will acts like array
    }

and such how you can see them 

you can take the arguments but the variable arguments as the last parameters
and you can take only one variable arguments inside the function

    void show(int size,int...array){
        // so size is interger and then array will be its input 

    }

the printf(" %d %d ",10,20);
the printf inside the cpp and it is a example of variable arguments

the variable arguments can also acts like a good input to take array but there are restriction are there 
when youre going to use the variable arguments so we must have to be keen about the input of the variable
