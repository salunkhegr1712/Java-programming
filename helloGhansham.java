// you can able to run the code by compiling first and then running the class which you
// get after compiling with the java ex:

// to compile the file 
// javac filename.java 

// after compiling youwill get a file of type object and it is a executable file you can able to run it with 

// java filename.class
// even that you dont have to be use the extension .class in that matter
