 in java the function are called as the methods 

if we have to use some function without creating a perticular object from the class then we just use keyword static so that we dont have to create object each time 

System.out this used to process an output and then we use System.in in order to take the input with the help of the input devices like keyboard

EX :
	System.out.println();
	Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in); here the Scanner is predefined object inside the java programming language 

String args[] inside main function is usefull for taking commandline argunment 

in Scanner the nextLine() can take multiword input and next() can only able to go for single word input and you can use whichever with accordance to your needs

hasIntNext() such functions are used to the is taken input is off specified type or not 


((Object)variableName).getClass().getSimpleName() this is code to find out the variable type; it will acts like type(variableName)

it is good programming practice to close the created scanner object at the end of code
