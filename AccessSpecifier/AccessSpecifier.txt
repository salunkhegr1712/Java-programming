there are main four possible access specifier are there inside the java programming language and that are :

    1) default
    2) private
    3) protected
    4) public


in class you can create and access specifier to:

    a) variables
    b) inner class
    c) functions

there are two types of relationships are there between two class

    a) subclass that is one class is subclass of another class

        {
            class AA{
                ---||----;
            }

            class BB extends AA{
                ---||---;
            }
            such connection is subclass relationship
        }
    
    b) non subclass relationships

        this can be like a class is using object of another class such connection are non-subclass
        {
            class AA{

            }
            class BB{
                AA a= new AA();
            }
        
        }
        or
        {
            class AA{

            }
            class BB{

            }
            having no relationship this also consist inside the non-subclass relationship
        }

# also there can be pair of class having

    a) class present in same packet
    b) class not present in same packet

    still that can have relationship but the mood of access specifier will change on basis of that


    # trick

now you have to remember trick so that at any step you can able to tell that in that relationship
the other class will able access the resources for that perticular access specifier or not

    default : the class from same packet will able to access resources
    private : same class elements can access resources
    protected : same packet entity and inherited entity can access resources
    public : anyone can access resources 



    access table :

                            default     private     protected   public

            same 
            class             yes         yes           yes       yes

            same packet
            subclass          yes         no            yes       yes

            same packet 
            non-subclass      yes         no            yes       yes

            diff. packet 
            subclass          no          no            yes       yes

            diff. packet            
            non-subclass      no          no            no        yes

    follow above table and you will able to use them to see that access will got or not
