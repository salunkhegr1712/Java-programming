in oops we are most focused on the object and the classes 

how can you declare and use the java classes and how to manage between the multiple classes

class circle{
    public double radius;
    public double area(){
        return Math.PI*Math.pow(radius,2);
    }
    public double perimeter(){
        return 2*Math.PI*radius;
    }

    # here in following code we are accessing the object inside same class with a method
    public void main(){
        circle c1=new circle();
        c1.radius=10;
        System.out.println(c1.area());
        System.out.println(c1.perimeter());
    }
}

public class filename{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        circle c1=new circle();
        c1.radius=3.5;
        System.out.println(c1.radius);
        System.out.println(c1.area());
        System.out.println(c1.perimeter());
    }
}

above is a example such that we create a class and also how can you access the the property and method
from them 

in java for each class a different className.class file will get generated so say you have 5 classes inside the mainfile.java so for
each of the class a different .class will be generated
