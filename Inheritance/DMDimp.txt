 this property is called dynamic method dispatch 

provided that Datatype1 is Parent of Datatype2

Datatype1 a=new Datatype2()

following is not allowd as Datatype1 is Parent of Datatype2
Datatype2 a=new Datatype1() 

so here a have reference of Datatype1 and it will get value from the Datatype2 so what is type of the a

so new keyword create a object of class "Datatype2" so the value stored in a will be of type "Datatype2"


class Parent{
    public void meth1(){};
    public void meth2(){};
    public void meth3(){};
}

class Child extends Parent{
    public void meth2(){};
    public void meth3(){};
    public void meth4(){};
}

here method 2 and 3 are overrided 

so now lets see dynamic memory dispatch

Parent a= new Child();

IMPORTANT :

    we can only called functions which are present in the reference only so even reference has meth4 we cant call it 
    and the overrided methods from Child will get called when you try to access that functions
