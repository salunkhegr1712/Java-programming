in this file i will write the notes on the java inheritance 

    their are two terms are there which one should know before get started :

        a) Generalization

        Grouping many things inside something and that Grouping is called as Generalization in this multiple entities will able to called by 
        a single name 

        example :

                                Smartphone :

                  a) Iphone     b) Samsung  c) Vivo

            all company creates the Smartphone so we Generalized words Iphone, Samsung, Vivo all into one word Smartphone

                                SUV :

                  a) Breeza  b) Creta  c) Seltos d) Duster      

            all cars Breeza, Creta, Seltos, Duster are fall in one category that is SUV cars so we Generalized all terms 
            in word SUV 

        b) Specialization

            Specialization is more specific, in this we will take one entity and after that we take previous versions and
            do subsequent modification so that forms new versions from it.

            example : 

                    Iphone 3
                       ||
                       ||
                    Iphone 4
                       ||
                       ||
                    Iphone 5

            so here we take Iphone 3 and all of its features and modify them into next version and Iphone 4 has own new modification
            and then it will give rise to new version

            in Specialization one is Derived and base class so in Iphone3 and Iphone4 Iphone4 is Derived from Iphone3 so
            Iphone3 is base class and Iphone4 is Derived class

        # Notes
                                                       _______________       _______________
            in java we do Specialization with help of || Inheritance || and || interfaces || in order to use the Generalization
                                                      -----------------      --------------- 

    # Inheritance

        Parent class
             ^
             |
             |
        child class

above is the notation how we going to show a class is gets Derived from the class 

the Parent class also called superclass and base class on which further child class will get Derived from
the child class is also known as the subclass or Derived class which is get Derived to

also main terms are their :

    a) available  
    b)  accessible

    access specifier will play very important role inside the inheritance in java language 

extends is keyword which is used to use the inheritance in java

we can only inherited data members inside function/methods not outside area inside class

# Important

in java if you declare data members inside a function with access specifier private then we its Derived class will not able 
to access them but if in base class with help of protected so in main function which is outside that class will not able to access 
that data members but at the same time the Derived class will able to access them inside the function

the protected data members are acts like public so you can access the protected data members outside class

if you have a same function in both Derived and base class so at that time the Derived class object will function inside it and
base class object will use the function which is inside it
