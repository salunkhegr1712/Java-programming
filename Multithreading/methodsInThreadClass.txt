# Methods of Thread Class
    In java.lang.Thread class, several constructors have been declared for different purposes.
    Some of them are:

    Thread(): no-argument constructor.
    Thread (String name): takes a string as an argument.
    Thread(Runnable r): takes reference (r) of a Runnable object as an argument.
    Thread(*Runnable r, String r): takes reference (r) of a Runnable object as well as a string as arguments.
