here in this file i will write the theory related to the java Package

so the java Package contains java code or Class or the interface which we can use in any java file

for Reference you can see the java lib and from that src.zip 

theory:

    java Package is nothing but a folder which contains some subpackage(sub-folder), .java file , .Class
    file and which we can use in code and make reuse of code and save efforts to write same piece of code
    multiple number of times

    the java supports user defined Packages which we use very often like 

    java.lang;
    java.util;

    and they are allot and they are very helpfull in our day to day life and can make our coding easy 

    you can also make your own Package and use them in code file which is excellent feature inside the java 
    programming Language


    Ex :
        import java.lang.*;

        so here import is keyword which can get files from Package to ram and we can use them according to our will

        . is used to go inside subpackage 
        so java.lang means we are currently in lang Package which is present inside in java Package

        * symbolise extract all files from that perticualar Package
    
    you can extract all things in Package with * or you can able to get specific file with name of file 

        ex:
            import java.util.Scanner;
        so we ar getting specific file from the java.util Package

    also there is not a neccesity that you have to use import you can call that Package and perticualar Class from It
    but it is not a good deal as you have write more code to do same task with is not optima


        // import class at start                                                //not import things at start
    import java.lang.String;                                    |               
    public class packagesInJava{                                |               public class packagesInJava{
                                                                |                   // main function of our java code       
        // main function of our java code                       |                   public static void main(String args[]){
        public static void main(String args[]){                 |
                                                                |                   // create object for String class
            // create a String class object                     |                   java.lang.String a = new java.lang.String();
            String a = new String ();                           |               }    
        }                                                       |
    }                                                           |

    as you can see you can save code with import Package at start
