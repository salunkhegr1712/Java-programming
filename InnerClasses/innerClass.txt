in this file  i will write the code on the inner classes

inner classes are the classes inside classes

ex :

    class One{

        class Two{

        }
    }

this is mainly done in order to reduce the complexity of the code and it will make your code
more dynamic 

the inner class came with some types along with it :

    types of inner classes :

        a) Nested Inner class
        b) Local Inner class
        c) Anonymous Inner class
        d) Static inner class

a) Nested inner class

{
        class Outer{
        private int a=10;
        public int z=11;

        // lets declare some function 
        public void func1(){
            System.out.println("public func1 from Outer class");
        }
        private void func2(){
            System.out.println("private func2 from Outer class");
        }
        // this is a inner class 
        class Inner {

            private int m=10;
            public int x=111;
            
            public void function1(){
                func1();
                func2();
                a=11;
                z=1111;
            }

        }

            // this function is used in order to access the inner class
            public void accessInnerClass(){
                
                // if you want to create inner class so you have to create a object for it 
                Inner zz=new Inner();
                zz.function1();
                System.out.println("value of m is : "+zz.m);
                System.out.println("value of m is : "+zz.x);
            }
            
        }

        // the main class
        public class nestedClass {

            // main function of our java code
            public static void main(String args[]){
                // Outer s=new Outer();
                // s.accessInnerClass();

                // output:
                // public func1 from Outer class
                // private func2 from Outer class
                // value of m is : 10
                // value of m is : 111

                // now we try to create object for inner class
                Outer.Inner  aa= new Outer().new Inner();
                // this you have search each time 
                aa.function1();

                // output:
                // public func1 from Outer class
                // private func2 from Outer class
            }
        }

}

    b) Local inner class

    this type of class are used inside a specific function only and its scope is in that function only we cant 
    able to access them in main function or even in same outer class we cant access it 

    such functions are used when we need to create a class only for a small interval and we can be able 
    create such local classes

    such local class can be used to inherit some class or to do implementation of some interface

    for local inner class it will create a .class file like:

    Outer$1Inner.class

    and if you have multiple local inner class and say of name of classes are  Inner and Hell :

    Outer$1Inner.class
    Outer$1Hell.class

    ex:
