# some important point 

# IMP
as we know the pointer do not exit so in java each varible is referrence and it itself a pointer 
you can assign it address of object or a address of a referrence
               
to delete a object :

    int a[]=new int[10];

    so just do 
    a=null;

and all data inside that node will be freed up 

                # Stack

A stack is a representation of nodes. There are two components to each node: data and next (storing address of next node).
Each node’s data portion contains the assigned value, and its next pointer directs the user to the node that has the 
stack’s subsequent item. The highest node in the stack is referred to as the top. 

# Features of Stack :
    
    Linear Data Structures using Java
    Follows LIFO: Last In First Out
    Only the top elements are available to be accessed
    Insertion and deletion takes place from the top
    Eg: a stack of plates, chairs, etc

# 4 major operations:
    
    push(ele) – used to insert element at top
    pop() – removes the top element from stack
    isEmpty() – returns true is stack is empty
    peek() – to get the top element of the stack
    All operation works in constant time i.e, O(1)

#Stack Advantages :
    
    Maintains data in a LIFO manner
    The last element is readily available for use
    All operations are of O(1) complexity

# Stack Disadvantages :
    
    Manipulation is restricted to the top of the stack
    Not much flexible

# Stack Applications :
    
    Recursion
    Parsing

                # Queue 
    
    What is Queue?

The queue is called an abstract data structure. Data is always added to one end (enqueued), and removed from the
other (dequeue). Queue uses the First-In-First-Out approach and data item that was stored initially will be 
accessed first in a queue.

# Features of Queue :

        Linear Data Structure
        Follows FIFO: First In First Out
        Insertion can take place from the rear end.
        Deletion can take place from the front end.
        Eg: queue at ticket counters, bus station


# 4 major operations:

    enqueue(ele) – used to insert element at top
    dequeue() – removes the top element from queue 
    peekfirst() – to get the first element of the queue 
    peeklast() – to get the last element of the queue 

    All operation works in constant time i.e, O(1)

#Queue Advantages :

    Maintains data in FIFO manner
    Insertion from beginning and deletion from end takes O(1) time

#Queue Applications :

    Scheduling
    Maintaining playlist
    Interrupt handling


            #Linked List

    * Linked list data structure helps the required objects to be arranged in a linear order.

    # Linked List Advantages
    
    Dynamic in size
    No wastage as capacity and size is always equal
    Easy insertion and deletion as 1 link manipulation is required
    Efficient memory allocation

    # Linked List Disadvantages
        
        If head Node is lost, the linked list is lost
        No random access is possible

    # Linked List Applications
    
    Suitable where memory is limited 
    Suitable for applications that require frequent insertion and deletion

    # Binary Tree
    
        In a binary tree, the branches of the tree are made up of up to two child nodes for each node. The left
        and right nodes are the common names for the two youngsters. Child nodes make references to their parents,
        whereas parent nodes are nodes with children.

    # Features of Binary Tree

        Hierarchical  Data Structure
        The topmost element is known as the root of the tree
        Every Node can have at most 2 children in the binary tree
        Can access elements randomly using index
        Eg: File system hierarchy

    # Common traversal methods:
        preorder(root) : print-left-right
        postorder(root) : left-right-print 
        inorder(root) : left-print-right

    # Binary Tree Advantages
    
    Can represent data with some relationship
    Insertion and search are much more efficient

    # Binary Tree Disadvantages
        
        Sorting is difficult
        Not much flexible
        Binary Tree Applications
        File system hierarchy
        Multiple variations of the binary tree have a wide variety of applications
